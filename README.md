# The_RPG_Project
Finally starting a RPG using GitHub ;-)

This project will always use the latest version of Unity 3D, so make sure you always update your version ;-)

Update 1: Fixed Folder Structure, so now the Empty Folder problem is eliminated.

Update 2: Added the Standard Assets Character Controller Package.

Update 3: Added the Standard Assets Environment Package.

Update 4: Added a Testing Scene with terrain, light, water and a First Person Controller.
